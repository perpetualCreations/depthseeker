This is the safe.list configuration file.
Please add IP addresses of safe hosts, to avoid falsely reporting admin requests.
Put each address on a new line, and make sure there is one address per line and only one address per line.
This also means no empty lines.
If left empty, no notifications will be dispatched, and instead will only be logged.
